# Study Stopwatch
Runs a timer for a specified amount of time, for a specified number of minutes. For instance, 3,30,Test would run a timer 3 times for a duration of 30 minutes and name the entry for what you were studying "Test".

## Configurations
The config.py module is meant for constant values to be stored. These values will never change after the program has begun.
Aside from the repetitions and duration of the repetitions, other values like the time for a break are specified within the config.py file.

# More features
1. I'd like to add a way to print out the user's total daily study time.
2. I'd like to implement some basic threading to allow the user to pause the timer, and to log out whatever time they've already studied.
3. I'd also like to add in a login/logout system.
4. I'd like to add a SQL lite database instead of file operations.
5. I'd like to add CIAN (confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation) for all stored data.
